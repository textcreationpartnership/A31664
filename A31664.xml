            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT is not that we love Contention, or deſire Controverſie, or are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient in bearing Reproaches, that we appear thus publick; but ſuch have been the repeated high Charges, and ſmart Laſhes that our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (more eſpecially, ſome of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Aſſembly,) have of late ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a liberty, liberally and laviſhly to beſtow upon us; that we find our ſelves concern'd, to Clear and Vindicate the Truth and Innocency of our Chriſtian Profeſſion from thoſe black Aſperſions, that have rendred it ſo frightful and formidable, as though 'twere only a meer complication of peſtilent Errors, as well as to ſatisfie the Minds of ſuch of our piouſly inclined Neighbours, as may be deſirous to hear us ſpeak for our ſelves, as alſo for the information of thoſe who may have been impoſed upon, by that dreſs wherein our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers have repreſented us. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103950:3"/> theſe can Object nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial againſt us now that hath not been long ſince over and over offer'd by ſome of the ſame Perſwaſion, and have as often received Anſwers from ſome or other of our Friends; (ſome of which have never yet been by them replyed unto) yet foraſmuch as thoſe may not have come to the view of many of our Neighbours, for whom this is chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, we thought it fit briefly to ſay ſo much as we think may be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to the preſent occaſion; and which perhaps with unprejudic'd Minds may beſpeak our Creed not ſo unſound and erroneous,<note place="margin">Eſth. 3.5.</note> as our ſomewhat different deportment hath rendred us obnoxious and contemptible, as well as diſtaſteful to thoſe who either ambitiouſly affect honour and reſpect,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.44.

            <p>We therefore deſire our well-diſpoſed Neighbours, candidly to weigh what we have to alledge againſt the Clamours of thoſe, who to be ſure will not ſet us out to our beſt advantage, and to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103950:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> receive an Account from our ſelves, what we are, and what we believe and hold for Chriſtian Truths; who certainly muſt needs know better our own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, than thoſe who perhaps never exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it, to any other end than to find fault, if ever they did it; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that you will not think it ſtrange, that we expreſs not our Belief in ſome particulars, in the affected Terms of other Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, but think it more reaſonable and ſafe to content our ſelves with that Dreſs of Language, in which the Holy Ghoſt thought fit to hand them to us in the Holy Scriptures. Thoſe moſt Excellent and Divine Writings, which above all others in the World, challenge our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and moſt diligent Reading, thoſe Oracles of God, and rich Chriſtian Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of Divine ſaving Truths, which were written for our Learning,<note place="margin">Ro. 15.4.</note> that we through patience and comfort of them may have hope, and are profitable for doctrine, reproof, correction,<note place="margin">2.

            <p>We Believe in that Great Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent God, that made and created all things, and gave us our Being, whom in ſincerity of heart we fear, reverence and worſhip, being ſeriouſly concern'd for our ſouls welfare to eternity.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103950:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the Holy Ghoſt, expreſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, rather than interpoſe with our nice and curious Subtilties? prying unneceſſarily into things that are too high for us; remembring that Secret things belong to God; and that thoſe that know moſt here, know only in part the things that are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.9, 12.</note> and ſee them but as through a Glaſs.

            <p>Nor do we thus celebrate Chriſt's inward and ſpiritual appearance in the Soul of Man, with the leaſt intent to diminiſh the true value and efficacy of what he did without us, or tranſacted for us as God manifeſted in Fleſh, but in concurrence with it, and purſuant to it, for the compleating the Salvation intended in it; neither is it, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, as he is without us; but we believe in him, as he is inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in meaſure, and alſo as he is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103950:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> in his own immenſe fulneſs without us, both as he is the one Offering for Sin, and alſo as he is that quickening Spirit, and immortal Seed by which we are begotten again, and made alive to God; and the Author of that Living Faith, through which 'tis ſavingly applied to us. For though he offered up himſelf once for all, and ſat down at the right hand of God, yet 'tis of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that he thus appear and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the Hearts of his People through all times, or otherwiſe they can never be happy, nor they receive the full ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his Death. But that he doth thus appear and work, is moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident; for ſince he is the alone Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and none are ſaved but thoſe who are Regenerated, that Grace or Operative Divine Agent (that is the Efficient of true ſaving Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,) muſt needs be Chriſt in us, our Hope of Glory. Wherefore 'tis that we ſo frequently invite People to regard, believe in, cloſe with, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him, as he is the true Light, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering Evil thus manifeſted in their inward Parts, for the full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Redemption and Reſtoration, that they may taſte and ſee for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the Lord is good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious;

Which truth our very Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers are obliged to acknowledge, notwithſtanding they ſo ridicule it in us.</p>
            <p>We hope it's no Error to avouch the Power of Chriſt to be ſtronger than that of the Devil,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> that he is able really to bind him, to bruiſe his Head, and break his Power, to diſpoſſeſs and caſt him out; to fulfil to the uttermoſt the end of his coming; to deſtroy the Works of the Devil, and to ſave thoſe from their Sins, who ſhall have true Faith in his Name and Power: Surely it's not inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt can or will, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purge his Floor; that he can indeed deliver out of the Priſon-houſe,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.23.</note> and reſtore Man out of the Fall to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and give him power to forſake the Devil, and all his Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We find it conſonant to Scripture, and the Goſpel-diſpenſation, to believe that thoſe who are regenerated and born again of the Spirit,<note place="margin">Ro. 6.6, 7, 11. 2 Pet. 1.4.</note> have through the Spirit mortified the firſt carnal cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature, which cannot pleaſe God;

            <p>But if any Men can be ſo hardy as to entertain an Opinion ſo derogatory to the Juſtice, Mercy, Love and Paternal Care of God, and repugnant to the Goſpel-meſſage; we cannot but admire what ſhould induce them to obtrude it upon others, and urge it as though 'twas a neceſſary Point to be believed in the Chriſtian Religion; for we cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how this begets Love to God, increaſeth Faith in Chriſt, and raiſeth our Veneration for him, excites to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and encourages Piety, which is that which advanceth true Religion; but on the contrary, it's plain, that it tends to the indulging ſome in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and procure in others a ſlight Eſteem of the Death and Sacrifice of Chriſt, as being partial, and caſts them into Deſpond; and probably may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage both to gratifie the Deſires of their Minds to the full extent, ſince nothing can alter ſuch a ſuppoſed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103950:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> Decree of God one way or the other. Yet we deny not the Preſcience of God, who fore-knows all things; things paſt, preſent, and to come, being at once preſent to him: ſo that it may be ſaid, ſuch who believe in Chriſt with that living active Faith, that works by Love, and excites to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and perſevere therein unto the end, and ſo know Salvation by him, are in him in whom the Election is before the World began; and that thoſe who ſo believe not, but reject the Tenders of his Love, and by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in Diſobedience, neglect ſo great Salvation, are condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Nor do we deny ſuch a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as that ſome are made Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards over more, and ſome fewer Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, according to which their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement ought to be: Where much is given, much is required; and where leſs is given, leſs is required; for God is juſt and equal in all his Ways, he is not a hard Maſter,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.14, to the 28.</note> that he ſhould exact or expect more than the Improvement of his own: Had he that received but one Talent, imploy'd it, and made it Two, we doubt not but it had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; for we believe that none are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103950:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> from Eternity abſolutely excluded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Talent, and that a Day alſo is afforded, wherein 'tis poſſible for them to improve it. So that though the Grace may work more powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome than in others, yet are all left without Excuſe.</p>
            <p>There is yet another Opinion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on this, which we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive neither, as they ſtate it, for which our Oppoſers think very ill of us; that is, once in a ſtate of Grace and ever ſo; that there is no total or final falling away from Grace. How this Doctrin promotes true Zeal and Piety, and improves Chriſtianity, we can't underſtand; nor ſee no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why its Votaries ſhould be ſo fond of it, but becauſe 'tis concordant to that of Perſonal Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; ſo that thoſe who imbrace the one, are bound to believe the other: But otherwiſe, certainly it tends ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſlacken than ſpur on People to that care and diligence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant unwearied watchfulneſs to Prayer, which our Lord ſo much exhorted to, and the Apoſtles ſo ſolicitouſly preſſe the Saints every-where to be found in, as of abſolute neceſſity.

But though we can't embrace their Opinion, for their Reaſons, and as they ſtate it; but own that 'tis poſſible for People to make a conſiderable Progreſs in Grace, and yet for want of a careful and conſtant Watchfulneſs to that Grace, they may fall away: Yet we believe ſuch a State and Growth in Grace, through a vigilant Attention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and ſuch a degree of Faith at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, as that there is no more go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth.</p>
            <p>Though we ſpeak of God's tendring, and Man's accepting or rejecting the Offers of his Love, yet far be it from us to aſſert, that fallen Man in his own Natural Eſtate, can of himſelf

Thoſe that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to God by the Word of Life, and are born again of the Spirit, are

Why may not the ſame Authority abſolve us from the uſe of this, and exempt us from being chargeable with the breach of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, as diſcharge them from waſhing one anothers Feet,<note place="margin">Jo. 13.4, 5, 8, 14, 15.</note> and ſecure them from the like cenſure?

For Tradition, Cuſtom and Education, makes greater impreſſions on Mens Minds, than perhaps every one may be ſenſible of; nor is it an eaſie task at firſt, to move them from thoſe things to which they have been faſtned by it. Would but People wholly relinquiſh theſe Prejudices, and conſider it impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially; 'tis probable there may appear no ſuch real difference, as juſtly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the one, and yet with equal reaſon to continue the other; ſince 'tis not that Bread that gives Life to the Soul, nor doth neceſſarily include it; but that Chriſt may be and is received, and fed on without it.

            <p>Since then God hath repleniſh'd our Hearts with his Grace, and hath not with-held his Heavenly Manna from us, but daily owns us by his comfortable Preſence, to our great ſatisfaction, under the Omiſſion of theſe things; ſupplying our Wants and Neceſſities, as we have recourſe unto him, in

'Twere well they were as thoughtful to fulfil all Righteouſneſs in every reſpect, and as zealouſly careful and concern'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and punctually perform all the Commands and Injunctions to which the Chriſtian Religion obligeth them, and to qualify themſelves to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inheritors of thoſe Bleſſings and Promiſes pronounced by our Saviour, as they tenaciouſly adhere to this; as though 'twere indeed the Sum both of Mens Duty and Enjoyments, and that their Salvation turned upon this very Pin; which yet People may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103950:40"/> while their Wills are unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and Luſts unmortified.

If all that mean well, did but purſue Vertue,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103950:40"/> love it, and encourage it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it appears; and hate Vice and Evil in all, and diſcountenance it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where; and make theſe the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of their Chriſtian Charity, rather than Parallel Opinions in leſſer Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, 'twould bring us nearer together, and more advance True Piety, than all their contending about different Apprehenſions in things far leſs eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial. God, who regards not Names, but Natures, knows among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and People who are his; and the Rule he left us to know alſo, was their Fruits, their Actions being the exertion of their Wills; all Mankind are either under the Power and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Spirit of God, or elſe of the Devil; all are either Carnal or Spiritual-minded; and as is the ſpring and bent of their Deſires and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſo is their Actions; each Birth have their proper Products, which are contrary to each other. So that let what Notions or Opinions ſoever poſſeſs Mens Heads, they live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Spirit and Principle that governs their Hearts.
